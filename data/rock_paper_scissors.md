# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## The game is between two people who make hand gestures: rock (fist), paper (hand flat), and scissors (index and middle fingers out only).  The logic is circular: rock breaks scissors, scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock.  A draw results if both play the same gesture and the game is repeated.

## Used in a US Federal court case to break the "gordian knot" (in the words of a frustrated judge) that lawyeresque posturing had created.

## Listening to the advice of an 11-year-old who counseled her elders to "play rock" led Christies to make millions of dollars over Sotheby's, who belittled studying the logic behind the moves.

## Although known in game theory as a "simultaneous zero-sum" game (which effectively means it's random and it's all-or-nothing), don't play it with a cheating robot: the University of Tokyo created a robot hand that always wins, by scanning the human players hand in a fraction of a second as it's moving and adapting it's play accordingly.  

## Created in China thousands of years ago, it's been popular in Japan for centuries, and is known as sansukumi-ken, meaning ken (fist) games with "the three who are afraid of one another" (each hand has an enemy).
