# Chickens can be hypnotized

## The proper name for this is "tonic immobility".

Sharks and trout, not just chickens, are vulnurable: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_immobility

Sharks are flipped.  Trout are tickled.  Chickens will follow a line drawn in front of them.  Chickens are also quite shocked when their head is stuck under their wing -- one stayed that way for 3 hours and 47 minutes.

## Ocras hypnotize sharks

Ocras -- also known as Killer Whales but who are actually dolphins -- have been known to flip a shark and hold it there until it drowns.  On a different "twist", Ocras also have been known to flip themselves, let a stingray (a shark cousin) glide into their mouth, then flip back over, flipping the stingray as well -- then hold it there until their paralyzed dinner is ready to eat.
