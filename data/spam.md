## Spam (as in ham) is revered in Oceania

Uncle Sam fondly became Uncle Spam when Marines shared their rations during the post-WW2 devastation.  It's been integrated into their culture, and is made in special ways just for them, with many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(food)#Varieties" target="_blank">different varieties available</a>.  "Macadamia Nut" must be particularly tasty.  There's even a yearly [Waikiki Spam Jam](https://spamjamhawaii.com), high-end cooking competitions, and a poet in Guam that writes about little else.

## Spam (not the ham) is loathed in email

Unsolicited emails were named after "[a skit on ... Monty Python's Flying Circus](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spam) in which chanting of the word Spam overrides the other dialogue".  You have to see it yourself to appreciate the [the powerful Spam chant of the Vikings](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9fly1), which dominates and seasons all other ongoing conversations.

## Hormel: the maker of Spam

They say Hormel isn't really happy with devastating email invasions named after their flagship product, but they made the most of it for the [Monty Python SpamALot musical](https://live.staticflickr.com/132/317748112_24b3d622d7_b.jpg).  This is particulary ironic, considering how a famous line from that is "I fart in your general direction".

## Min-new-shah

[Gary Thuerk sent the first spam email](https://moosend.com/blog/gary-thuerk-people-make-the-same-mistakes-over-and-over-again/), back when the 1st generation "Internet" had 2600 users.  It generated $12 million dollars of computer equipment sales.
