# SPAM - A story with hidden conflicts

## Spam (as in "ham") is revered in Hawaii

It's manufactured in special ways just for them, with many different varieties available: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(food)#Varieties.  "Macadamia Nut" must be particularly tasty.

The yearly Waikiki Spam Jam festival even has calendar girls: https://spamjamhawaii.com/, and big-name corporate sponsors.

## Spam (not the ham) is loathed in email

Unsolicited emails were named -- verified by Merriam-Websters -- after "a skit on the British television series Monty Python's Flying Circus in which chanting of the word Spam overrides the other dialogue".

## Hormel: the maker of Spam

They aren't really happy with devestating email invasions named after their flagship product, but they decided to make the most of it for the Monty Python SpamALot musical: https://live.staticflickr.com/132/317748112_24b3d622d7_b.jpg

This is particulary ironic, considering how a famous line from that is "I fart in your general direction".
