# SPAM - A product that keeps on giving

## Spam (as in "ham") is revered in Hawaii

It's manufactured in special ways just for them, with many 
[different varieties available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(food)#Varieties){:target="_blank"}.  "Macadamia Nut" must be particularly tasty.

The yearly [Waikiki Spam Jam](https://spamjamhawaii.com) even has calendar girls, and big-name corporate sponsors.

## Spam (not the ham) is loathed in email

Unsolicited emails [were named after](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spam) "a skit on the British television series Monty Python's Flying Circus in which chanting of the word Spam overrides the other dialogue".

You have to see it yourself to appreciate the [the powerful Spam chant of the Vikings](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9fly1), adding a robust flavor over all other conversations.

Fun fact: [Gary Thuerk sent the first spam email](https://moosend.com/blog/gary-thuerk-people-make-the-same-mistakes-over-and-over-again/), back when the 1st generation "Internet" had 2600 users.

## Hormel: the maker of Spam

They say Hormel isn't really happy with devastating email invasions named after their flagship product, but they made the most of it for the [Monty Python SpamALot musical](https://live.staticflickr.com/132/317748112_24b3d622d7_b.jpg).

This is particulary ironic, considering how a famous line from that is "I fart in your general direction".
