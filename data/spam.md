# SPAM

## Spam (as in "ham") is revered in Hawaii, and is manufactured in special ways just for it.

There are many different varieties: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(food)#Varieties.  "Macadamia Nut" must be particularly flavorful.

The yearly Spam festival even has calendar girls: https://spamjamhawaii.com/.  Other places have Spam festivals, too, but this one has big-name corporate sponsors.

## Spam (not the ham) is loathed in email

Unsolicited emails started being called that at the beginning of mass email usage, according to Merriam-Websters, after "a skit on the British television series Monty Python's Flying Circus in which chanting of the word Spam overrides the other dialogue".

You have to see it yourself to appreciate the robust Vikings powerfully chanting "Spam" to override all other conversations:

## Hormel, the maker of Spam, isn't really happy with devestating email invasions being called spam, but it decided to make the most of it for the Monty Python SpamALot musical: https://live.staticflickr.com/132/317748112_24b3d622d7_b.jpg
