  <h4 id="minutiae">Minutiae</h4>
  <p><em>plural, \muh-NOO-shee-ee, latin for &quot;trifles&quot; or &quot;details&quot;</em></p>
  <h4 id="minutia"><em>Minutia</em></h4>
  <p><em>singular, \muh-NOO-shee-uh\ or \muh-NOO-shuh, latin for &quot;smallness&quot;</em></p>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Minutia comes from minutus, the adjective for <em>&quot;small&quot;</em>.   From minutus we get <em>&quot;minute&quot;</em>.  That's usually accepted as 60 seconds -- except when it's just <em>&quot;an instant or point of time&quot;</em>.</p></li>
  <li><p>Merriam-Webster believes that Minutiae is merging with Minutia, based upon their analysis of spoken transcripts, and <em>&quot;being re-analyzed as a zero plural.&quot;</em>   And who are we to disagree?</p></li>
  <li><p>Suggestion: <strong>muh-NOO-shuh</strong> -- it's easier to say.   But that's getting into the minutiae.</p></li>
