# minutiae

## Minutia
*singular, \muh-NOO-shee-uh\ or \muh-NOO-shuh\, latin for "smallness"*
## Minutiae
*plural, \muh-NOO-shee-ee\, latin for "trifles" or "details"*

1. Minutia comes from minutus, the adjective for "small".  From minutus we get "minute".  That's usually accepted as 60 seconds -- except when it's just "an instant or point of time". 

2. Merriam-Webster believes that Minutiae is merging with Minutia, based upon their analysis of spoken transcripts, and "being re-analyzed as a zero plural."  And who are we to disagree?

3. In summary: this is about "the small, precise, or trivial details of something".  Personally, I like muh-NOO-shuh.  But that's getting into the minutiae.
