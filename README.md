## Minutiae
*plural, \muh-NOO-shee-ee\, latin for "trifles" or "details"*
*## Minutia*
*singular, \muh-NOO-shee-uh\ or \muh-NOO-shuh\, latin for "smallness"*

1. Minutia comes from minutus, the adjective for *"small"*.    &nbsp;  From minutus we get *"minute"*.    &nbsp;  That's usually accepted as 60 seconds -- except when it's just *"an instant or point of time"*. 

2. Merriam-Webster believes that Minutiae is merging with Minutia, based upon their analysis of spoken transcripts, and *"being re-analyzed as a zero plural."*  &nbsp;  And who are we to disagree?

3. In summary: this is about *"the small, precise, or trivial details of something"*.    &nbsp;  Personally, I like **muh-NOO-shuh**.    &nbsp;  But that's getting into the minutiae.
